Code for Docker Image Optimization and Best Practice seminar of [haidx7](https://gitlab.bcnfpt.com/haidx7).

This is a sample Machine Learning API which wraps a very simple ML model: Classifier.
The project walk you through a series of Dockerfile configurations to demonstrate the optimizing techniques 
to reduce Docker Image size and speed up build time.

The detail techniques were explained in the [Seminar's Slide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1coGoTJt6zf_ei7lyD4wHKFQ0xgQVBUng/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=107816312936660323708&rtpof=true&sd=true).
